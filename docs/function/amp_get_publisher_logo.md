## Function `amp_get_publisher_logo`

```php
function amp_get_publisher_logo();
```

Get the publisher logo.

The following guidelines apply to logos used for general AMP pages.
 &quot;The logo should be a rectangle, not a square. The logo should fit in a 60x600px rectangle., and either be exactly 60px high (preferred), or exactly 600px wide. For example, 450x45px would not be acceptable, even though it fits in the 600x60px rectangle.&quot;
