## Function `amp_get_slug`

```php
function amp_get_slug();
```

Get the slug used in AMP for the query var, endpoint, and post type support.

The return value can be overridden by previously defining a AMP_QUERY_VAR constant or by adding a &#039;amp_query_var&#039; filter, but *warning* this ability may be deprecated in the future. Normally the slug should be just &#039;amp&#039;.
