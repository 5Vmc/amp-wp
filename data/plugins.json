Click on it, and you can now create your first table. Just click on the Add New Table button.</p>\n<p>Feel free to add as many columns and rows as you want—inserting rows and columns is extremely easy.</p>\n<p>You have a few options to make your table stand apart. First, choose one of the three color schemes: standard, purple, or black. Second, choose your table design: default or custom. Block, left, and inline-block are the floating modes for your table. Finally, enable or disable the full width of the table.</p>\n<p>Once you finish your table, name it and save it. All you have to do now is to copy the shortcode and paste wherever you want, you can for example embed it in the Gutenberg Shortcode Block! (It works in the classic WordPress editor too)</p>\n<p>Consider purchasing our <a href=\"https://superbthemes.com/plugins/superb-tables/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">premium version</a> for $11 to unlock more features!</p>\n<h3>Why use a HTML table</h3>\n<p>Displaying data within a comparison table is beneficial for not only readers but also content creators. A table does a better job than long paragraphs of text, underlined phrases, and bulleted lists. It shows a lot of information side by side in a concise format. Bloggers and content creators should create tables and insert the data. There’s no need to search for breathtaking expressions, cool descriptions, or digestible lists of items. It’s just pure data, and everyone is happy with this situation. You can read our full guide on <a href=\"https://superbthemes.com/how-to-add-a-table-to-your-wordpress-website/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How to Add a Table to Your WordPress Website</a> with Superb Tables.</p>\n<h3>Responsive Tables</h3>\n<p>We developed Superb Tables mobile friendly by taking responsiveness into account, and as a result, you can make a WordPress table responsive by using our plugin. The tables are fully responsive regardless of the number of rows and columns. The plugin works on all mobile devices and tablets (iPhone, Android etc.). The plugin works with AMP.</p>\n<h3>SEO Friendly WordPress Tables With Schema Markup</h3>\n<p>“Schema markup“ and “featured snippets“ are two interconnected terms that are being used by more and more bloggers, SEO practitioners, and developers. Have you noticed that Google now provides complex answers in the form of lists, tables, paragraphs, or videos directly on the results page? Those are featured snippets.</p>\n<p>Moz claims that 23% of all search results include a featured snippet—a descriptive box displayed on the search results page providing information for your query. It may include paragraphs, lists, videos, or tables. You have to consider featured snippets when choosing a table plugin—can it help Google generate a featured snippet from the data within your table?</p>\n<p>We developed Superb Tables with featured snippets in mind, and you can use the plugin worry-free. We used schema markup, which is the code that helps search engine bots generate snippets from your content, including tables. It&#8217;s a great way for affiliate websites and blogs to promote their content.</p>\n<p>You must use WordPress tables with schema markup to get featured snippets on search engines, and Superb Tables is a reliable solution in this respect.</p>\n<h3>Add Tables everywhere &amp; use them for Any Purpose</h3>\n<p>You can insert the SEO optimised tables with microdata everywhere through the shortcode. For example in a popup, widgets, Gutenberg blocks, email newsletter sent from your WordPress website. You can also insert it on any post or page, even category pages, blog feed, search page and your 404 page! The plugin is made for affiliates marketers and affiliate websites, having a good SERP rank in Google and Bing is critical. When you&#8217;re looking to improve your ranking then all of your plugins must be SEO optimized, otherwise it&#8217;s gonna be hard to create monetization through ads programs such as AdSense and Amazon Associates Program.</p>\n<p>We know that business is important for any modern blog or affiliate marketing website that&#8217;s looking to make a revenue from it. Remember to use HTTPS (SSL) on your website, a CDN and lightweight stats tracking tools such as Google Analytics to better your SEO as well.</p>\n<h3>Guide to creating your Superb Tables</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>In the wordpress admin panel, go to the sidebar and click &#8216;Superb Tables&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Click the green &#8216;Add new table&#8217; in the top left corner</li>\n<li>Fill in your table data, click &#8216;Save&#8217;</li>\n<li>Click &#8216;Superb Tables&#8217; in the left sidebar and copy paste the &#8216;Table Shortcode&#8217;</li>\n<li>Insert the Table Shortcode (For example [spbtbl_sc id=1] ) in a post, page, widget or in HTML.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You&#8217;re done!</p>\n<h3>Resources &amp; Inspiration</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Auto-Expand: https://codepen.io/vsync/pen/frudD</li>\n<li>Data Table: https://codepen.io/alassetter/pen/cyrfB</li>\n<li>Table DnD: https://github.com/isocra/TableDnD/</li>\n<li>Table icon: https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/1608863/table_icon#size=256</li>\n<li>Custom confirm: https://codepen.io/Ana_Champion/pen/JRbZEL</li>\n<li>Table design inspiration: https://codepen.io/lukepeters/pen/bfFur</li>\n<li>Table design inspiration: https://codepen.io/alassetter/pen/cyrfB</li>\n<li>Table design inspiration: https://uicookies.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/table-responsive-v2-1000&#215;750.jpg</li>\n<li>Table design inspiration: https://uicookies.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/table-responsive-v1.jpg</li>\n</ul>\n","download_link":"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/superb-tables.1.0.8.zip","tags":{"content-tables":"content tables","responsive-tables":"responsive tables","table":"table","tables":"tables"},"donate_link":"","icons":{"1x":"https://ps.w.org/superb-tables/assets/icon-256x256.png?rev=2044672","2x":"https://ps.w.org/superb-tables/assets/icon-256x256.png?rev=2044672"},"wporg":true},{"name":"Floating Button","slug":"floating-button","version":"4.3","author":"<a href=\"https://wow-estore.com/\">Wow-Company</a>","author_profile":"https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpcalc","requires":"3.2","tested":"5.8","requires_php":"5.3","rating":80,"ratings":{"1":1,"2":1,"3":0,"4":0,"5":5},"num_ratings":7,"support_threads":1,"support_threads_resolved":0,"active_installs":2000,"downloaded":32490,"last_updated":"2021-07-21 5:47am GMT","added":"2018-09-08","homepage":"https://wordpress.org/plugins/floating-button/","short_description":"Easily create a custom sticky floating buttons.

But these plugins often have too many options and are very complicated for ordinary users. Access to their configuration section, you will easily get lost in a maze of explanations and options that you sometimes don&#8217;t understand. Besides, there are ads!</p>\n<p><strong>So how can an ordinary user use an SEO plugin?</strong></p>\n<p>SEO should be an integrated part of WordPress, where users don&#8217;t need or need very little effort to configure for SEO. The main reason is that not everyone understands the terms of SEO and how to configure them optimally.</p>\n<p>So, we made <a href=\"https://wpslimseo.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><strong>Slim SEO</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Slim SEO is a full-featured SEO plugin, that&#8217;s done right!

They do all sorts of nasty stuff and waste server resources. The Blackhole plugin helps to stop bad bots and save precious resources for legit visitors.</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n<p>First the plugin adds a hidden trigger link to the footer of your pages. You then add a line to your robots.txt file that forbids all bots from following the hidden link. Bots that then ignore or disobey your robots rules will crawl the link and fall into the trap. Once trapped, bad bots are denied further access to your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>I call it the &#8220;one-strike&#8221; rule: bots have one chance to obey your site&#8217;s robots.txt rule. Failure to comply results in immediate banishment. The best part is that the Blackhole only affects bad bots: human users never see the hidden link, and good bots obey the robots rules in the first place.

If you are planning to use this plugin on a private, internal site, then you may like to restrict user registration to users under a single Google Suite organization. This configuration variable does that.</p>\n<p>Add your domain name, without any schema prefix and <code>www,</code> as the value of <code>WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_WHITELIST_DOMAINS</code> constant or in the settings <code>Settings &gt; WP Google Login &gt; Whitelisted Domains</code>. You can whitelist multiple domains. Please separate domains with commas. See the below example to know how to do it via constants:</p>\n<pre><code>`\n</code></pre>\n<p>define( &#8216;WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_WHITELIST_DOMAINS&#8217;, &#8216;example.com,sample.com&#8217; );<br />\n    `</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If a user already exists, they <strong>will be allowed to login with Google</strong> regardless of whether their domain is whitelisted or not. Whitelisting will only prevent users from <strong>registering</strong> with email addresses from non-whitelisted domains.</p>\n<h3>Hooks</h3>\n<p>Filter <code>wp_google_login_scopes</code><br />\nThis filter can be used to filter existing scope used in Google Sign in.<br />\nYou can ask for additional permission while user logs in.<br />\nThis filter will provide 1 parameter <code>scopes</code> in callback, which contains array of scopes.</p>\n<h4>wp-config.php parameters list</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_CLIENT_ID</code> (string): Google client ID of your application.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_SECRET</code> (string): Secret key of your application</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_USER_REGISTRATION</code> (boolean) (optional): Set <code>true</code> If you want to enable new user registration. By default, user registration defers to <code>Settings &gt; General Settings &gt; Membership</code> if constant is not set.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>WP_GOOGLE_LOGIN_WHITELIST_DOMAINS</code> (string) (optional): Domain names, if you want to restrict login with your custom domain.

It aims at integrating mathematical formulae into World Wide Web pages and other documents.</p>\n<p>The MathML block uses MathJax to render MathML formulas in the editor and on the front end of a website. MathJax (https://www.mathjax.org/) is <em>A JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all browsers.</em></p>\n<p>To test a MathML block and enter a formula, for example: <code>\\[x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}\\]</code>.</p>\n<p>To test using math formulas inline, type an formula into a block of text, select it and hit the &#8216;M&#8217; icon in the control bar. For example: <code>\\( \\cos(θ+φ)=\\cos(θ)\\cos(φ)−\\sin(θ)\\sin(φ) \\)</code>. <em>Note: if you are copying and pasting formulas into the rich text editor, switching to HTML/code editor mode is less likely to reformat your pasted formula.</em></p>\n<p>This plugin is compatible with the <a href=\"https://amp-wp.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official AMP plugin</a> by rendering <a href=\"https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-mathml/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>amp-mathml</code></a> on <a href=\"https://amp.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">AMP pages</a>.</p>\n<h3>Technical Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires PHP 5.6+.</li>\n<li>Requires WordPress 5.0+.</li>\n<li>Issues and Pull requests welcome on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/adamsilverstein/mathml-block.</li>\n</ul>\n","download_link":"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/mathml-block.zip","tags":{"block":"block","block-editor":"block-editor","gutenberg":"gutenberg","math":"math","mathml":"mathml"},"donate_link":"","icons":{"1x":"https://ps.w.org/mathml-block/assets/icon-128x128.png?rev=2002452","2x":"https://ps.w.org/mathml-block/assets/icon-256x256.png?rev=2002452"},"wporg":true},{"name":"Calculated Fields Form","slug":"calculated-fields-form","version":"1.1.14","author":"<a href=\"https://cff.dwbooster.com\">CodePeople</a>","author_profile":"https://profiles.wordpress.org/codepeople","requires":"3.0.5","tested":"5.8","requires_php":false,"rating":96,"ratings":{"1":20,"2":2,"3":4,"4":26,"5":675},"num_ratings":727,"support_threads":100,"support_threads_resolved":99,"active_installs":60000,"downloaded":3469605,"last_updated":"2021-08-31 10:52pm GMT","added":"2013-03-12","homepage":"https://cff.dwbooster.com","short_description":"Calculated Fields Form allows you to create both simple and rich forms, quickly like a&hellip;","description":"<p>The &#8220;Calculated Fields Form&#8221; plugin allows you to create web forms with calculated fields, whose values are dynamically calculated based on other fields&#8217; values in the web form.</p>\n<p>The possibilities are unlimited. For example, you can create forms with financial calculations, date operations to create reservation forms, and calculate the product prices. The plugin includes text operations for editing, translation, or advertising services. There are more advanced operations available such as determining the distance between addresses or generating graphs. The resulting forms are 100% mobile responsive.</p>\n<p>The most impressive thing is that you don&#8217;t need to hire a programmer to create the forms. With basic knowledge, you will have a professional form in just five minutes.</p>\n<p>Creating a form is all visual. The &#8220;Calculated Fields Form&#8221; plugin includes a form editor with multiple controls. Such as text fields, numeric fields, currency fields, slider controls, email fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, container fields, page breaks to create multipage forms, and most importantly, calculated fields.</p>\n<p>The form editor includes a list of controls, a property bar to easily edit field properties, a dashboard where you can design your forms, and the attributes for form configuration. Also, the plugin comes with multiple predefined layouts to change the forms&#8217; appearance. If there are not enough predefined layouts for your project, there is a style editor to customize the form&#8217;s design.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Calculated Fields Form&#8221; plugin includes integration with popular page builders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Classic WordPress Editor</li>\n<li>Gutenberg Editor</li>\n<li>Elementor</li>\n<li>Page Builder by SiteOrigin</li>\n<li>Beaver Builder</li>\n<li>WPBakery Page Builder</li>\n<li>DIVI Builder</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For other editors, it is possible to insert the form into the pages via its shortcode.

Updates contain bug fixes as well as new features. The WordPress directory distributes the updates for the free version of the plugin. But for commercial versions, it would be necessary to register your copy of the plugin. The following link describes the registration process: <a href=\"https://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#register\" title=\"Registering the plugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CLICK HERE</a>This section mainly contains notes on features of the form builder that are too detailed to include in the main description.</p>\n<h4>Conditional rules</h4>\n<p>It is possible to show or hide form fields (dependent fields) based on the options selected in checkbox fields, radio buttons, the options selected in dropdown menus, or the result of calculated fields.</p>\n<p>The value of a dependent field is zero when it is hidden/disabled. The plugin excludes the disabled form fields from the submission.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cff.dwbooster.com/blog/2020/03/01/dependencies/\" title=\"Description about the use of dependencies\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Additional details about the use of dependencies</a></p>\n<h4>Predefined values</h4>\n<p>The predefined values in the fields have two possible uses:</p>\n<p>1- To fill the field by default. This makes it easier for the end-user to enter values.</p>\n<p>2- Hint of the values to be entered in the field (like &#8220;Enter your name&#8221;). To use the predefined value as a placeholder, you must tick the &#8220;Hide predefined value on click&#8221; checkbox. The value will disappear once the user starts filling in the field. The calculated fields&#8217; equations ignore placeholders.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;User Instructions&#8221; attribute</h4>\n<p>The &#8220;User instructions&#8221; attribute in the field settings allows you to instruct the user on how to fill in the field. By default, the instructions appear as smaller text on the public website. But they can be configured as tooltips.</p>\n<h4>Adding CSS layout keywords</h4>\n<p>The &#8220;Add CSS layout keywords&#8221; attribute in the fields settings allows you to apply CSS styles to fields. You must only enter the name of the CSS class names, and not their definitions.</p>\n<p>You can define the CSS classes via the &#8220;Customize Form Design&#8221; attribute in the &#8220;Form Settings&#8221; tab. This attribute contains a CSS editor with syntax highlighting and error checking.</p>\n<p>If you want to assign several class names to the field, separate them by space characters.</p>\n<p>The plugin includes multiple predefined classes that you can assign to the form fields.</p>\n<p>More information about the form&#8217;s design can be found by reading the following post in the plugin&#8217;s blog:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cff.dwbooster.com/blog/2020/01/12/form-design/\" title=\"Customizing the form's design\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Customizing the form&#8217;s design</a></p>\n<p>The classes listed below allow you to align two, three, or four fields on the same line:</p>\n<pre><code>column2\ncolumn3\ncolumn4\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example, if you want to put two fields on the same line, give both fields the class name &#8220;column2&#8221;.</p>\n<p>There are other variants for displaying several fields on the same line, such as container fields (Div or Fieldset). Container fields allow you to select the number of columns in your configuration. The following post describes all the alternatives for positioning the fields in the form:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cff.dwbooster.com/blog/2019/01/06/columns/\" title=\"Formatting the form (distributing the fields in columns)\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Formatting the form (distributing the fields in columns)</a></p>\n<h4>Multi-page form</h4>\n<p>To create multi-page forms, you must insert &#8220;Page break&#8221; controls between fields belonging to different pages.</p>\n<p>When the user presses the &#8220;Next Page&#8221; button, the plugin validates the fields in the current form. If there is any validation error (such as an unfilled required field), the plugin stops the &#8220;Next page&#8221; action.</p>\n<h4>Hidden calculated fields</h4>\n<p>Calculated fields include a checkbox in the configuration that allows them to be hidden from the public website. This feature is essential in those fields that are used to calculate intermediate values or when we want to show the results only in emails or thank you pages.</p>\n<h4>Equation / Formula format for calculated fields</h4>\n<p>Below, some possible formulas are included as examples, but the possibilities are endless.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With simple mathematical operations:</p>\n<pre><code>fieldname1 + fieldname2\n\nfieldname1 * fieldname2\n\nfieldname1 / fieldname2\n\nfieldname1 - fieldname2\n\nfieldname1 - fieldname2\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With mathematical operations involving multiple fields and grouped fields:</p>\n<pre><code>fieldname1 * (fieldname2 + fieldname3)\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With rounding operations. Round the result to two decimal places:</p>\n<pre><code>PREC(fieldname2 / fieldname3, 2)\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are infinite number of formulas that can be created using complex structures. For example, the following formula includes conditional statements:</p>\n<pre><code>(function () {\nif (100 &lt; fieldname3) return fieldname1 + fieldname2;\nif (fieldname3 &lt;= 100) return fieldname1 * fieldname2;\n})();\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For complex formulas/equations you must use the function format with return statement to return the result to the calculated field:</p>\n<pre><code> (function () {\n    var result = 0;\n    /* Your code here */\n    return result;\n}) ();\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Operations and operators to use in equations/formulas</h4>\n<p>One of the &#8220;Calculated Fields Form&#8221; strengths is the ability to use any valid JavaScript code to implement the equations/formulas.</p>\n<p>However, the plugin includes a wide variety of operations and operators to simplify the development process.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#mathematical-module\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mathematical Operations and Operators</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#conditions-module\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Conditional Operations</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#managing-fields-module\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Field Handling Operations</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#connection-module\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Operations for interacting with external services</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#url-module\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Operations for handling URLs and query strings</a></p>\n<p>In addition to the operation modules listed above, the Developer and Platinum versions of the plugin include additional modules:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#datetime-module\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Date Time Operations</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#financial-module\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Financial Operations</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#distance-module\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Distance and Travel Time Operations</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#chart-module\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Operations to generate charts</a></p>\n<h4>Controls available in the form generator of the &#8220;Calculated Fields Form&#8221;</h4>\n<p>The complete list of controls is available from this link: <a href=\"http://cff.dwbooster.com/documentation#common-fields\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">CLICK HERE</a></p>\n<h4>Create JavaScript variables from parameters received by &#8220;GET&#8221; or &#8220;POST&#8221;, &#8220;SESSION&#8221; variables, or &#8220;COOKIES&#8221; to use in the equations</h4>\n<p>The plugin includes the shortcode [CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR] to generate JavaScript variables from parameters received by &#8220;GET&#8221; or &#8220;POST&#8221;,  &#8220;SESSION&#8221; variables, or &#8220;COOKIES&#8221;:</p>\n<pre><code>[CP_CALCULATED_FIELDS_VAR name=\"...\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the shortcode, you must replace the &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; symbols with the name of the parameter or variable.

When displaying the price of a product, you may want to split the form into two pages. The first page would request the information needed to calculate the price, and the second page would include the calculated field with the final price. Also, you could use the &#8220;Instruct. Text&#8221; fields to indicate the terms, conditions, and validity period of the offer.</p>\n<p>Note that you can make the &#8220;Instruct. Text&#8221; fields dependent on the calculated value. This allows you to vary the text displayed to the user depending on the calculated price, as the terms, conditions, or offers often depend on the transaction amount.</p>\n<h3>Add-ons</h3>\n<p>The add-ons are only distributed with the Developer and Platinum versions of the plugin.</p>\n<p>The plugin lists the add ons in the &#8220;Add-ons area&#8221; of the settings page. To enable the add-ons, you must tick their corresponding checkbox and press the &#8220;Activate/Deactivate Add-ons&#8221; button.</p>\n<h4>Server-Side Equations add-on &#8211; included in the Developer and Platinum versions of the plugin</h4>\n<p>Define equations with PHP code on the server-side.

It is privacy-friendly as it uses neither cookies nor a third party.</p>\n<p>An interactive chart is followed by lists of the most common reference sources and target pages. The period of statistics and length of lists can be set directly in the dashboard widget.</p>\n<h3>Data Privacy</h3>\n<p>In direct comparison to statistics services such as <em>Google Analytics</em>, <em>WordPress.com Stats</em> and <em>Matomo (Piwik)</em> <em>Statify</em> doesn&#8217;t process and store personal data as e.g. IP addresses – <em>Statify</em> counts site views, not visitors.</p>\n<p>Absolute privacy compliance coupled with transparent procedures: A locally in WordPress created database table consists of only four fields (ID, date, source, target) and can be viewed at any time, cleaned up and cleared by the administrator.</p>\n<p>Due to this tracking approach, Statify is 100% compliant with GDPR and serves as an lightweight alternative to other tracking services.</p>\n<h3>Display of the widget</h3>\n<p>The plugin configuration can be changed directly in the <em>Statify</em> Widget on the dashboard by clicking the <em>Configure</em> link.</p>\n<p>The amount of links shown in the <em>Statify</em> Widget can be set as well as the option to only count views from today. Of course, older entries are not deleted when changing this setting.</p>\n<p>The statistics for the dashboard widget are cached for four minutes.</p>\n<h3>Period of data saving</h3>\n<p><em>Statify</em> stores the data only for a limited period (default: two weeks), longer intervals can be selected as option in the widget. Data which is older than the selected period is deleted by a daily cron job.</p>\n<p>An increase in the database volume can be expected because all statistic values are collected and managed in the local WordPress database (especially if you increase the period of data saving).</p>\n<h3>JavaScript tracking for caching compatibility</h3>\n<p>For compatibility with caching plugins like <a href=\"http://cachify.de\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cachify</a> <em>Statify</em> offers an optional switchable tracking via JavaScript. This function allows reliable count of cached blog pages.</p>\n<p>For this to work correctly, the active theme has to call <code>wp_footer()</code>, typically in a file named <code>footer.php</code>.</p>\n<h3>Skip tracking for spam referrers</h3>\n<p>The comment blacklist can be enabled to skip tracking for views with a referrer URL listed in comment blacklist, i. e. which considered as spam.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve problems or think you’ve found a bug (e.g. you’re experiencing unexpected behavior), please post at the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/statify\">support forums</a>.</p>\n<h3>Contribute</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Active development of this plugin is handled <a href=\"https://github.com/pluginkollektiv/statify\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on GitHub</a>.</li>\n<li>Pull requests for documented bugs are highly appreciated.</li>\n<li>If you want to help us translate this plugin you can do so <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/statify\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on WordPress Translate</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n","download_link":"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/statify.1.8.3.zip","tags":{"analytics":"analytics","dashboard":"dashboard","pageviews":"pageviews","privacy":"privacy","statistics":"statistics"},"donate_link":"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=TD4AMD2D8EMZW","icons":{"1x":"https://ps.w.org/statify/assets/icon-128x128.png?rev=2355063","2x":"https://ps.w.org/statify/assets/icon-256x256.png?rev=2355063"},"wporg":true},{"name":"LIQUID BLOCKS GALLERY 37+ Free Designs","slug":"liquid-blocks","version":"1.1.1","author":"<a href=\"https://lqd.jp/wp/\">LIQUID DESIGN Ltd.</a>","author_profile":"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lqd","requires":"5.2","tested":"5.8","requires_php":false,"rating":100,"ratings":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":1},"num_ratings":1,"support_threads":1,"support_threads_resolved":0,"active_installs":4000,"downloaded":19990,"last_updated":"2021-07-22 6:55am GMT","added":"2019-10-18","homepage":"https://lqd.jp/wp/plugin.html","short_description":"If you’re looking to create block page sections that look great give LIQUID BLOCKS a&hellip;","description":"<p>If you’re looking to create block page sections that look great give LIQUID BLOCKS a try.</p>\n<p>In Gutenberg Block Template &amp; Design Gallery, Just select your favorite design.

Provides responsive embed codes, works with AMP.</p>\n<p>Just like default WordPress embeds, Iframely will detect URLs in your posts and replace it with responsive embed codes. Supports all usual suspects such as YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, Facebook, Giphy, GfyCat, Imgur, Google +, GitHub Gists, Storify, SlideShare, Streamable, Vidme, Reddit, Dailymotion, Spotify, Tableau, Prezi, Apester, QZZR, Tidal, MLB. Well over two thousand of providers and keeps growing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://iframely.com/embed\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Test your URL here</a> to check if we support it.</p>\n<p>Iframely also generates and hosts summary cards as URL previews for general articles. It includes your own site, and Iframely can replace the default embed cards that your publish via WordPress for other sites to use.</p>\n<h4>API key and paid/free</h4>\n<p>Powered by Iframely cloud service and requires an account with us. Grab an API key for extended trial at <a href=\"https://iframely.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">iframely.com</a>, or test the plugin out without an API key.</p>\n<p>Before you push the plugin to production, a <a href=\"https://iframely.com/plans\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">service subscription</a> is required to avoid any possible disruptions.</p>\n<p>We maintain an overwhelming number of integrations and widgets in the background for you, and make sure your sites remains fast and keeps your users happy. This requires a substantial effort on our part, and we won&#8217;t be able to provide it without requiring a service subscription.</p>\n<h4>How to use:</h4>\n<p>The plugin works the same way the standard oEmbed is supported by WordPress: URL on a separate line.</p>\n<p>For example,</p>\n<pre><code>Check out this cool video:\n\nhttp://your.url/here\n\nThat was a cool video.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Iframely also has its own shortcode <code>[iframely]http://your.url/here[/iframely]</code>.</p>\n<h4>Heads-up:</h4>\n<p>Iframely does not simply wrap URLs with <code>&lt;iframe src=...&gt;</code> code. That&#8217;s not what Iframely is for. We can only match URLs to the known embed codes if publisher offers them for manual copy-paste, or generate a summary card for URL preview if a publisher provides at least a thumnnail image.</p>\n<h4>To keep default embed providers</h4>\n<p>By default, Iframely will inject itself to be the first embeds provider in the list, thus intercepting all URLs. It means that the default providers that are later in the list won&#8217;t get called and will thus be disabled.</p>\n<p>It means Iframely replaces default YouTube, Vimeo, Twitter, other oEmbed plugins that you might have(like JetPack), etc.</p>\n<p>Although we should support the same providers and output the same code, just make it responsive and add extra features, you can still disable such behavior and tell Iframely to only process links that otherwise don&#8217;t have an embed provider.</p>\n<p>Just choose this option in your settings. It will essentially put Iframely to be the last in the list, be &#8220;a catcher&#8221;, rather then &#8220;an interceptor&#8221;.</p>\n<h4>URL editor options</h4>\n<p>You can fine-tune many aspects of Iframely on your dashboard at iframely.com. This would include some most common settings for popular rich media publishers. Our support team can also fine-tune many other publishers, just for you.</p>\n<p>However, you might need a per-post editor for the widgets options. And, Iframely does provide this too.

Rather, this plugin is intended to provide the PWA building blocks and coordination mechanism for these themes and plugins to not reinvent the wheel and also to not conflict with each other. For example, a theme that implements the app shell model should be able to extend the core service worker while a plugin that provides push notifications should be able to do the same. Themes and plugins no longer should have to each create a service worker on their own, something which is inherently problematic because only one service worker can be active at a time: only one service worker can win. If you are developing a plugin or theme that includes a service worker, consider relying on this PWA plugin, or at least only use the built-in implementation as a fallback for when the PWA plugin is not available.</p>\n<p>In versions prior to 0.6, no caching strategies were added by default. The only service worker behavior was to serve an offline template when the client&#8217;s connection is down or the site is down, and also to serve an error page when the server returns with 500 Internal Server Error. As of 0.6, there is a new “Offline browsing” toggle on the Reading Settings screen in the admin. It is disabled by default, but when enabled a <a href=\"https://web.dev/offline-cookbook/#network-falling-back-to-cache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">network-first</a> caching strategy is registered for navigations so that the offline page won&#8217;t be shown when accessing previously-accessed pages. The network-first strategy is also used for assets from themes, plugins, and WordPress core. In addition, uploaded images get served with a <a href=\"https://web.dev/offline-cookbook/#stale-while-revalidate\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">stale-while-revalidate</a> strategy. For all the details on these changes, see the <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/pwa-wp/pull/338\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pull request</a>.</p>\n<p>Documentation for the plugin can be found on the <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/pwa-wp/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub project Wiki</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Development of this plugin is done <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/pwa-wp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on GitHub</a>.

Pre-existing Code blocks on a site are automatically extended to include syntax highlighting. Doing server-side syntax highlighting eliminates the need to enqueue any JavaScript on the frontend (e.g. Highlight.js or Prism.js) and this ensures there is no flash of unhighlighted code (FOUC?). Reducing script on the frontend improves frontend performance and it also allows for the syntax highlighted code to appear properly in AMP pages as rendered by the <a href=\"https://amp-wp.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official AMP plugin</a> (see also <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/issues/972\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">ampproject/amp-wp#972</a>) or when JavaScript is turned off in the browser.</p>\n<p>In addition to not adding any JavaScript to the frontend, the stylesheets needed for styling the Code block will only be added to the page if there is a Code block present. The stylesheets are added inline when the Code block is rendered, ensuring that they do not block rendering of any content higher in the page. If stylesheets fail to load for any reason, the block simply renders without styling, with one key exception: highlighted lines are wrapped in <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\"><code>mark</code> elements</a> so they&#8217;ll get highlighted regardless, including in RSS Feeds and posts syndicated in email (as long as the <code>mark</code> element is supported in the client).</p>\n<p>This extended Code block uses language auto-detection to add syntax highlighting, but you can override the language in the block&#8217;s settings sidebar. (There is currently no syntax highlighting of the Code block in the editor.) The plugin supports all <a href=\"https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">programming languages</a> that <a href=\"https://github.com/scrivo/highlight.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">highlight.php</a> supports (being a port of <a href=\"https://highlightjs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">highlight.js</a>). The Code block also is extended to support specifying the aforementioned highlighted lines. There is also a checkbox for whether to show line numbers on the frontend (with the numbers being non-selectable). Lastly, given inconsistencies across themes as to whether lines in a Code block should be wrapped, this plugin adds styling to force them to no-wrap by default, with a checkbox to opt-in to wrapping when desired.</p>\n<p>For advanced usage, please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/westonruter/syntax-highlighting-code-block/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugin wiki</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin is <a href=\"https://github.com/westonruter/syntax-highlighting-code-block\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">developed on GitHub</a>.

That&#8217;s why we built WPForms to adapt to your workflow and allow you to create custom contact forms in minutes. By using our easy to use <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/features/drag-drop-online-form-builder/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">drag and drop online form builder</a>, you can easily add custom form fields, rearrange them, and basically create a complete contact form in 5 minutes or less.</p>\n<p>But don&#8217;t just take our word.

My clients love WPForms and it&#8217;s one of the few plugins they can use without any training. As a developer I appreciate how fast, modern, clean and extensible it is.<br />\n  Bill Erickson &#8211; Expert WordPress Consultant</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Pre-built Form Templates</h4>\n<p>Building contact forms in WordPress can be time consuming. Why?</p>\n<p>Because every other WordPress contact form builder plugin requires you to build your contact form from scratch. The truth is it&#8217;s often not necessary to create a contact form completely from scratch unless you really want to.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking to create a simple contact form, marketing form, request a quote form, donation form, payment order form, registration form, or a subscription form, we have a form template for you inside our contact form builder.</p>\n<p>WPForms comes with <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/features/form-templates/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">pre-built form templates</a> to help you save time. You can add, remove, or re-arrange fields as necessary.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/templates/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">100+ Pre-Made WPForms Form Template Demo</a></p>\n<h4>Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly and Optimized for Speed</h4>\n<p>WPForms&#8217; contact forms are 100% responsive and mobile-friendly by default. We also optimized every query on the front-end and the back-end to ensure maximum speed &#8211; Yes, WPForms is one of the fastest WordPress contact form plugin.</p>\n<p>You can embed your contact form on any page with optimized title and description. With the speed and proper formatting, WPForms is also one of the most SEO friendly contact form plugin.</p>\n<h4>All the Fields &amp; Features that You Need to Succeed</h4>\n<p>From star ratings to file uploads to multi-page contact forms with progress bar, we have all the fields you need.</p>\n<p>You can easily integrate your contact forms with an email marketing service or collect payments for bookings and orders. WPForms allows you to do it all.</p>\n<p>The best part is, you can do it all without hiring a developer.</p>\n<p>See what one business owner has to say about WPForms&#8217; contact form:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a business owner, time is my most valuable asset. WPForms allow me to create smart contact forms with just a few clicks. With their pre-built form templates and the drag &amp; drop builder, I can create a new form that works in less than 2 minutes without writing a single line of code. Well worth the investment.<br />\n  David Henzel &#8211; Co-founder of MaxCDN</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Surveys &amp; Polls</h4>\n<p>Along with contact form, you can also use WPForms to create surveys and polls.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/surveys-and-polls-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">WordPress Survey plugin addon</a> comes with smart survey fields including likert scale, star ratings, multiple choice, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and more, so you can create custom survey forms like Survey Monkey (without the high costs).</p>\n<p>WPForms offer the best-in class survey reporting. You can use our interactive reports to customize the graphs, export them for your presentations, and even display the aggregate results to your users.</p>\n<p>The best part about WPForms survey reports is that it can retroactively work on any old contact form or feedback survey contact form created with WPForms.</p>\n<p>Thousands of businesses love WPForms surveys for creating employee feedback form, customer feedback form, online petition form, and more.</p>\n<p>You can also use the surveys &amp; polls addon to easily create a poll on your site. To save you time when creating a user poll, we have added a built-in poll forms template. Our poll feature offers real-time reports, so you can share poll results with the user immediately after they submit their vote.</p>\n<p>Just like the contact form, you can embed your surveys and polls inside any post, page, or widget area in WordPress.</p>\n<h4>Membership and Default WordPress Forms</h4>\n<p>Aside from building simple contact forms which every WordPress site needs, WPForms also helps you create better default WordPress forms.</p>\n<p>For example, you can use WPForms to create custom WordPress login forms and custom WordPress user registration forms which are great for <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/ultimate-guide-to-creating-a-wordpress-membership-site/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">membership sites</a>.</p>\n<p>For membership sites, you can also use WPForms to create a password-protected contact form or even a members only contact form which is restricited to logged-in users only.</p>\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re not using a WordPress membership plugin, you can use WPForms to create membership registration forms, online RSVP forms, and other address book contact forms.</p>\n<p>Bloggers and publishers can use our WordPress post submission forms to accept guest posts, testimonials contact form to collect testiomnials, and partnership agreement forms to grow their business.</p>\n<h4>Payment Form, Donation Form, Booking Form, and More</h4>\n<p>While WPForms started out as a contact form plugin, it has evolved into a powerful custom forms solution that you can use to create a payment form, donation form, registration form, online booking form, mobile form, and basically any type of custom form you need.</p>\n<p>WPForms integrates with both PayPal and Stripe, so you can easily create a credit card payment form to accept payments on your website. If you&#8217;re using SSL, then you can use our Stripe Payment form to accept credit card payments.

This aims towards compliance with how the new GDPR regulations recommend implementing cookie control for your site.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Privacy Policy page setting that WordPress core provides, you also get a settings to optionally set an extra Cookie Policy page, and you can easily link to either of them from the cookie consent notice.</p>\n<p>The cookie notice content and appearance can easily be tweaked using the Customizer, with an immediate live-preview of what your changes will look like.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, another important thing that this plugin takes care of, other than most other cookie consent plugins, is that it actually ensures cookies are only placed if the respective cookie type has been allowed by the visitor. The plugin does this by implementing cookie rules for WordPress itself, and also for the following plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\">AMP</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/\">Google Analytics for WordPress by MonsterInsights</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/\">Jetpack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-analytics/\">Simple Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-site-kit/\">Site Kit by Google</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>More plugins will be supported in the future. If you are a developer though, it&#8217;s also very easy to add cookie rules for other code, by using the flexible cookie rule component the plugin provides as an extension point.</p>\n<h4>Feature Summary</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lightweight and easy-to-use:</strong> Simply activate the plugin, and the notice will appear.</li>\n<li><strong>Live Preview:</strong> Use the Customizer to adjust the notice to your needs, with an instant live preview.</li>\n<li><strong>Customizable Appearance:</strong> Specify the notice position, colors, border, button size and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Customizable Content:</strong> Adjust the notice heading, text and button label to your preferences. You can easily link to your cookie policy page or privacy policy page, and even give visitors granular control about which cookie types they allow.</li>\n<li><strong>Cookie Policy Support:</strong> Define an optional cookie policy page if your site has one, or alternatively provide an ID attribute to the cookie section in your privacy policy.</li>\n<li><strong>Cookie Integrations:</strong> Supported cookies are only set once the visitor has given their consent. The cookie rules implemented also respect the more granular cookie control.</li>\n<li><strong>JavaScript-driven:</strong> The cookie notice is inserted into the page as necessary via JavaScript, but at the same time provides easy access to whether it should be displayed via its PHP API.</li>\n<li><strong>AMP Support:</strong> The notice is fully AMP-compatible using <code>&lt;amp-consent&gt;</code>, integrating seamlessly with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\">AMP plugin</a>. It integrates with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/web-stories/\">Web Stories</a> as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Coding Best Practices:</strong> The plugin is fully object-oriented and is coded after best practices, such as using interfaces, traits, dependency injection or the single responsibility principle. It also implements modern coding features requiring PHP 7, such as scalar type hints or return type hints.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disclaimer</h4>\n<p>This plugin does not provide any legal protection.

Scale your business with WordPress on the front-end and free up server resources from things like catalog management, processing payments, managing fulfillment logistics and more with BigCommerce on the back end.</p>\n<p>Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, you get access to our native ecommerce features from a single plugin, the ability to sell across multiple channels and marketplaces from a single location, and best of all, an embedded checkout experience that takes on PCI compliance and customer security on your behalf.</p>\n<h4>Quick Start!</h4>\n<p>Look at details from the latest release, including new features and enhancements here: https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/releases</p>\n<p>Dive into how you set up and customize your site using BC4WP using our guides here: https://developer.bigcommerce.com/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/getting-started/introduction</p>\n<p>Have a suggestion for how we can be better? Ping the team! wordpress-suggestions@bigcommerce.com</p>\n<h4>DIFFERENT FROM YOUR TRADITIONAL PLUGIN</h4>\n<p>We’ve taken a very different approach to ecommerce in WordPress. We set out to build our plugin the WordPress Way: deliver value to the community, build it with WordPress experts and make something developers can call their own.</p>\n<p>The BigCommerce for WordPress plugin leverages the best aspects of both platforms, allowing WordPress to manage content and BigCommerce to manage ecommerce.</p>\n<h4>SCALABLE ECOMMERCE FOR WORDPRESS</h4>\n<p>Continue to tap into the unrestricted customization of WordPress while pairing it with the most scalable SaaS ecommerce engine. BigCommerce lets you build complex catalogs, manage large volumes of concurrent traffic, orders and analytics.</p>\n<p>The BigCommerce plugin ports over a copy of your product catalog and stores products as custom post types in WordPress. It also creates pages for your cart, checkout, account profiles, sign in, shipping &amp; returns, gift certificates and order history.</p>\n<p>The key difference to our approach is that you don’t need to install additional extensions to get access to common ecommerce features. Instead, you get instant access to many common (and advanced) features, such as complex catalog support, global payment gateways, currency handling, taxation, shipping calculations and centralized channel management; all out-of-the-box.</p>\n<h4>OFFLOAD BACKEND RESOURCES</h4>\n<p>Our philosophy is that processing orders and running your store shouldn&#8217;t affect the uptime and speed of your site — which can hurt your SEO, conversion, and brand. The BigCommerce plugin does the heavy commerce lifting, letting you scale your ecommerce without losing speed or uptime.</p>\n<h4>LET US HANDLE PCI COMPLIANCE</h4>\n<p>Taking on your own PCI compliance comes with a huge amount of liability and risk. BigCommerce powers the full checkout experience, assuming the burden of PCI compliance for you.</p>\n<h4>EXTENSIVE PAYMENT GATEWAYS</h4>\n<p>BigCommerce has over <a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/payments/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">65 payment gateway integrations</a> available out-of-the box, serving 100+ countries and over 250 local payment methods.</p>\n<p>To help you reduce costs, we’ve <a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/paypal-rates/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">pre-negotiated special credit and debit card processing rates with PayPal</a>, our preferred payment solution. The more you grow with BigCommerce and upgrade your plan, the lower your rates can go.</p>\n<h4>HIGHLY SCALABLE PRODUCT CATALOG</h4>\n<p>BigCommerce is built for large, complex catalogs with up to 600 SKUs per product, and 250 product values for a single option. Our native catalog structure treats single products (including variants, details, SKUs, etc.) as a single API call, making inventory syncing with ERPs, PIMs (and WordPress) fast.</p>\n<h4>MULTI-CHANNEL SELLING &amp; MANAGEMENT</h4>\n<p>With the core BigCommerce platform, you now have access within the control panel to sell across multiple marketplaces simultaneously, such as eBay, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, Square and more! Save time and eliminate errors and overselling with bulk listing, automatic inventory syncing and unified order and fulfillment management.</p>\n<h4>USE YOUR FAVORITE WORDPRESS THEME</h4>\n<p>BigCommerce for WordPress will work with any WordPress theme, but it may require some styling to make it fit perfectly. Are you a theme developer? We’d love to promote your BigCommerce for WordPress compatible theme. <a href=\"mailto:&#x74;&#111;&#112;&#x68;&#x65;&#114;.&#x64;&#101;&#114;&#x6f;&#x73;&#105;&#097;&#x40;&#x62;&#105;&#x67;&#x63;&#111;&#109;&#x6d;&#x65;&#114;c&#x65;&#046;&#099;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#063;s&#x75;&#098;&#106;&#x65;&#x63;&#116;&#061;&#x57;&#x6f;&#114;&#x64;&#x50;&#114;&#101;&#x73;&#x73;&#037;2&#x30;&#084;&#104;&#x65;&#x6d;&#101;%&#x32;&#048;&#068;&#x65;&#x76;&#101;&#108;&#x6f;&#x70;&#101;&#x72;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Get in touch with us here</a>.</p>\n<p>To start, we recommend choosing a cross-browser compatible WordPress ecommerce theme, since the theme options included will better match what an online store requires.</p>\n<h4>ECOMMERCE WITH GUTENBERG</h4>\n<p>We’re big supporters of Gutenberg and built our plugin to support both the classic editor and Gutenberg. Whether you’re inserting shortcodes in classic mode or product blocks in Gutenberg, we will continue to enable support for both.</p>\n<h4>SECURED USER ACCOUNTS &amp; LOGINS</h4>\n<p>In addition to offering you peace of mind with a secure checkout experience, we also extend this level of security to your shoppers, their accounts and logins, and payment information — all managed by BigCommerce.</p>\n<h4>GLOBAL SHIPPING STREAMLINED</h4>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Shipping-Setup\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">support</a> all major global carriers, offer real-time carrier quotes, allow for free shipping, flat rates, dropshipping and more. With our deep ShipperHQ integration, you can even specify rates by product, category, customer group, quantity, destination, dimensions and more.</p>\n<h4>FLEXIBLE SHOPPING CART</h4>\n<p>We are bringing over a decade of focusing on building online stores to every WordPress website. Through this we bring our flexible shopping cart, along with it&#8217;s extensive customization options, so can offer enterprise grade promotions and discounts within a fully responsive layout, without additional extensions that other WordPress ecommerce plugins require.</p>\n<h4>MULTIPLE SITES; ONE CONTROL PANEL</h4>\n<p>Even if you sell across multiple WordPress sites, you shouldn&#8217;t have to manage them all in separate places. BigCommerce gives you a single control panel to manage your catalog, orders and shipping, all from one place. Streamline your admin experience and spend less time managing ecommerce on WordPress.</p>\n<p>Beyond WordPress, the endpoints we’ve opened on our platform allow you to build commerce into any sort of experience. Looking to launch a site in React? Interested in developing a mobile app? Want to integrate with an in-house POS? <a href=\"https://developer.bigcommerce.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">All of these can be built</a> and managed from within the BigCommerce Control Panel.</p>\n<h4>COMPLEX ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS INTEGRATIONS</h4>\n<p>A huge benefit of having a SaaS ecommerce engine behind the scenes is that the core platform is already built for mid-market and enterprise use cases. Natively connect to your existing ERP suites, PIM software, OMS solutions, POS systems or marketing automation tools right out of the box.</p>\n<h4>AMP SUPPORT</h4>\n<p>Unique to most WordPress ecommerce plugins, BigCommerce for WordPress also includes support for Accelerated Mobile Pages. To activate, install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\">official Google plugin</a>.</p>\n<h4>SUPPORT AND SERVICES</h4>\n<p>All of our BigCommerce customers have access to our <a href=\"https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/247-support/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">24/7</a> live phone, chat, and email support, run from our headquarters in Austin, Texas. For larger enterprise customers, we offer dedicated account management and implementation management services as part of your plan. We also have an ever-growing collection of help, support, and how-to guides in our <a href=\"https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/BigCommerce-for-WordPress-Resources\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">help center</a>.</p>\n<h4>BUILT WITH DEVELOPERS IN MIND</h4>\n<p>BigCommerce for WordPress was built by WordPress developers, with developers in mind. Our plugin is open source and available for you to fork, extend and modify as your needs require.</p>\n<p>Our plugin supports WordPress’ standard method of overriding template files so you can modify out-of-the-box designs. Customize your product cards, lists and shopping cart without risking plugin updates that will undo your changes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are many <a href=\"https://developer.bigcommerce.com/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/extending-the-plugin/code-reference\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">hooks and filters</a>, so you can manipulate content to your heart’s content.</p>\n<h4>JOIN OUR BIGCOMMERCE COMMUNITY</h4>\n<p>All BigCommerce customers get access to our ever-growing online <a href=\"https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/community\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">community</a> to answer questions, discuss ecommerce strategies, learn about the latest product updates, contribute ideas and more.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in contributing to BigCommerce for WordPress, head over to our <a href=\"https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-for-wordpress\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">GitHub Repository</a>.</p>\n","download_link":"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/bigcommerce.4.16.0.zip","tags":{"ecommerce":"ecommerce","online-store":"online store","retail":"retail","sell-online":"sell online","storefront":"storefront"},"donate_link":"","icons":{"1x":"https://ps.w.org/bigcommerce/assets/icon-256x256.png?rev=2141502","2x":"https://ps.w.org/bigcommerce/assets/icon-256x256.png?rev=2141502"},"wporg":true},{"name":"Yoast SEO","slug":"wordpress-seo","version":"17.0","author":"<a href=\"https://yoa.st/1uk\">Team Yoast</a>","author_profile":"https://profiles.wordpress.org/joostdevalk","requires":"5.6","tested":"5.8","requires_php":"5.6.20","rating":96,"ratings":{"1":718,"2":124,"3":170,"4":616,"5":25755},"num_ratings":27383,"support_threads":541,"support_threads_resolved":492,"active_installs":5000000,"downloaded":351599745,"last_updated":"2021-08-24 7:59am GMT","added":"2010-10-11","homepage":"https://yoa.st/1uj","short_description":"Improve your WordPress SEO: Write better content and have a fully optimized WordPress site using the Yoast SEO plugin.","description":"<h3>Yoast SEO: the #1 WordPress SEO plugin</h3>\n<p>Since 2008 Yoast SEO has helped millions of websites worldwide to <strong>rank higher in search engines</strong>.</p>\n<p>Yoast’s mission is <strong>SEO for Everyone</strong>.

Right now, the project is in the first phase of a four-phase process that will touch every piece of WordPress &#8212; Editing, Customization, Collaboration, and Multilingual &#8212; and is focused on a new editing experience, the block editor.</p>\n<p>The block editor introduces a modular approach to pages and posts: each piece of content in the editor, from a paragraph to an image gallery to a headline, is its own block. And just like physical blocks, WordPress blocks can added, arranged, and rearranged, allowing WordPress users to create media-rich pages in a visually intuitive way &#8212; and without work-arounds like shortcodes or custom HTML.</p>\n<p>The block editor first became available in December 2018, and we&#8217;re still hard at work refining the experience, creating more and better blocks, and laying the groundwork for the next three phases of work. The Gutenberg plugin gives you the latest version of the block editor so you can join us in testing bleeding-edge features, start playing with blocks, and maybe get inspired to build your own.</p>\n<h3>Discover More</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User Documentation:</strong> See the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/\">WordPress Editor documentation</a> for detailed docs on using the editor as an author creating posts and pages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Developer Documentation:</strong> Extending and customizing is at the heart of the WordPress platform, see the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Developer Documentation</a> for extensive tutorials, documentation, and API reference on how to extend the editor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Contributors:</strong> Gutenberg is an open-source project and welcomes all contributors from code to design, from documentation to triage.
